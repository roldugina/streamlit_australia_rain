[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://australia-rain.streamlit.app/)

Predicting whether rainfall will occur in Australia, leveraging 10 years of observational data.
The project demonstrates the machine learning process from data preprocessing to deploying model using Streamlit library.

## Project Overview

### Dataset:

The dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia. 
You can download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

### Technical Aspects

  Libraries: scikit-learn, streamlit  
  Algorithms Used: Random Forest Classifier
  
  Output: The model predicts rainfall occurrence and provides the rain probability
