## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a web application that predicts whether rainfall will occur in a given region of Australia. The goal is to demonstrate the complete machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to deploying the trained model using the Streamlit library.

## Dataset:

The Kaggle dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia.

## Technologies Used:

   - **Python** for data processing and machine learning.
   - **Streamlit** for web app deployment.
   - **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models.
   - **Pandas** for data manipulation.
   - **Joblib** for saving a pre-trained model
  
  Output: The model predicts rainfall occurrence and provides the rain probability.
  
  The project uses a virtual environment for dependency management.
